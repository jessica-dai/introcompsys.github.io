I've been at my current job for around a year. Though my title is "ML Engineer," my company is a rather small startup, which means I've done a variety of roles.
Some of the customer-facing work includes doing demos of the product to technical stakeholders from potential customers; helping new customers onboard to the product 
with our Python SDK; explaining how to structure calls to our API. Our tech stack includes Python and Go; I use VSCode for Python & Jupyter notebooks, and Goland for Go. 
Here are some random thoughts I have about things I didn't realize coming out of school: 

- For data scientists, Jupyter notebooks are a great way to play around quickly with code snippets. Both notebooks and more typical scripts can be used in production settings, though scripts are more common.
- Many IDEs offer rich support when it comes to autocomplete, package and import management, analyzing memory, etc, that are really good 95% of the time. In 5% of cases, it *really* helps if you understand how these things work in your language (e.g. debugging weird import errors is much easier if you have a good idea of how python handles packages and local files, instead of *only* relying on autocompletes) 
- Debuggers (built-in IDEs) are your friend! That said, in my experience, debugging real software is harder than debugging school assignments--you'll sometimes need to set up mock servers so you can run your code locally to debug.
- Everyone messes up git sometimes!!!
